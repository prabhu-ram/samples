<h2>Directive Types</h2>
<p>
    You can implement the following types of directives:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Element directives</li>
    <li>Attribute directives</li>
    <li>CSS class directives</li>
    <li>Comment directives</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Of these, AngularJS recommends that you try to use element and attribute directives, and leave the CSS class
    and comment directives (unless absolutely necessary).
</p>

<p>
    The type of a directive determines how the directive is activated. An element directive is activated when
    AngularJS finds a matching HTML element in the HTML template. An attribute directive is activated
    when AngularJS finds a matching HTML element attribute. A CSS class directive is activated when
    AngularJS finds a matching CSS Class. And, a comment directive is activated when AngularJS finds
    a matching HTML comment.
</p>

<h2>A Basic Directive</h2>

<p>
    You register a directive with a module. Here is an example of how that looks:
</p>
<pre>&lt;foo&gt;This text will be replaced&lt;foo&gt;</pre> as follows:
<br>
<foo>This text will be replaced</foo>
<p>

<p>
    Notice the call to the <code>directive()</code> function on the module. When you call this function
    you can register a new directive. The first parameter to the <code>directive()</code> function call
    is the name of the directive to register. This name is what you use in your HTML templates when you
    want to activate the directive. In this example I have used the name '<code>div</code>' which means
    that the directive is activated every time an HTML element named <code>div</code> is found in the
    HTML template.
</p>

<p>
    The second parameter passed to the <code>directive</code> function is a factory function. This
    function should return a directive definition when invoked. AngularJS will invoke this function
    to obtain a JavaScript object which contains the definition of the directive. If you look inside
    the function in the above example you will see that it does indeed return a JavaScript object.
</p>

<p>
    The JavaScript object returned from the factory function has two properties: A <code>restrict</code>
    field and a <code>template</code> field.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>restrict</code> field is used to set if the directive should be activated by a matching
    HTML element, or an element attribute. By setting <code>restrict</code> to <code>E</code> you specify
    that only HTML elements named <code>div</code> should activate the directive. By setting <code>restrict</code>
    to <code>A</code> you specify that only HTML attributes named <code>div</code> should activate the directive.
    You can also use a value of <code>AE</code> which will match both HTML element names and attribute names.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>template</code> field is an HTML template that will replace the content of the matched
    <code>div</code> element. It will work as if the content of the matched <code>div</code> element had not been there,
    and instead this HTML template had been located in the same place.
</p>
<h2>The template and templateUrl Properties</h2>

<p>
    The easiest way to create your own directives is as shown in the example above. Your
    directive is intended to generate HTML, and you put that HTML inside the <code>template</code>
    attribute of the directive definition object.
</p>
<p>
    In case that HTML template grows big, it is gets hard to write and maintain the HTML inside
    a JavaScript string. You can then put the HTML into its own file and have AngularJS load
    it from that file. You do so by putting the URL of the HTML template file into the
    <code>templateUrl</code> property of the directive definition object. Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>&lt;seconddirective&gt; &lt;seconddirective&gt; </pre>
<seconddirective></seconddirective>
<p></p>
<b>Note:</b> the file include in the above won't work on Chrome as chrome will block.  Works if served out of a webserver.
<p></p>

<h2>Isolating the $scope From the Directive</h2>

<p>
    In the example above the <code>userinfo</code> directive was bound hard to the <code>$scope</code> variable
    because the HTML template referenced the <code>textToInsert</code> property directly. Referencing <code>$scope</code>
    variables directly makes it hard to reuse the directive more than once within the same controller, since the
    <code>$scope</code> variables typically have the same values everywhere inside the same controller. For instance,
    if you wanted to have this HTML in your page.
</p>
<pre class="codeBox">
&lt;userinfo&gt;&lt;/userinfo&gt;
&lt;userinfo&gt;&lt;/userinfo&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    Then the two <code>&lt;userinfo&gt;</code> elements would be replaced by the same HTML template, which is bound
    to the same <code>$scope</code> variable. The result would be that the two <code>&lt;userinfo&gt;</code>
    elements would be replaced by the exact same HTML code.
</p>

<p>
    To be able to bind the two <code>&lt;userinfo&gt;</code> elements to different values in the <code>$scope</code>
    object, you need to bind the HTML template to an <i>isolate scope</i>.
</p>

<p>
    An isolate scope is a separate scope object tied to the directive. Here is how you define it in the
    directive definition object:
</p>

<userinfo user="first"></userinfo>
<br>
<userinfo user="second"></userinfo>
<p>
    These two <code>&lt;userinfo&gt;</code> element contain a <code>user</code> attribute. The value of
    these attributes contain the names of properties in the <code>$scope</code> object which are to be
    referenced by the isolate scope object's <code>userinfo</code> property.
</p>
<h2>The compile() and link() Functions</h2>

<p>
    If you need to do something more advanced inside your directive, something that you cannot
    do with an HTML template, you can use the <code>compile()</code> and <code>link()</code>
    functions instead.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>compile()</code> and <code>link()</code> functions define how the directive is to
    modify the HTML that matched the directive. 
</p>

<p>
    The <code>compile()</code> function is called once for each occurrence of the directive in the HTML page.
    The <code>compile()</code> function can then do any one-time configuration needed of the element containing the
    directive.
</p> 

<p>    
    The <code>compile()</code> function finishes by returning the <code>link()</code>
    function. The <code>link()</code> function is called every time the element is to be
    bound to data in the <code>$scope</code> object.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned, you add the <code>compile()</code> function to
    the directive definition object, and the <code>compile()</code> function has to return
    the <code>link()</code> function when executed.
